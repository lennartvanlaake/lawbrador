<p>22 Official Journal of the European Communities 27. 3 . 72
</p>
<p>Article 39
</p>
<p>1 . For the purpose of the progressive introduction
of the Common Customs Tariff and of the ECSC
unified tariff, the new Member States shall amend
their tariffs applicable to third countries as follows :
</p>
<p>(a ) in the case of tariff headings in respect of which
the basic duties do not differ by more than 15%
in either direction from the duties in the Com­
mon Customs Tariff or the ECSC unified tariff,
these latter duties shall be applied from 1
January 1974 ;
</p>
<p>( b ) in other cases , each new Member State shall ,
from the same date, apply a duty reducing by
40% the difference between the basic duty and
the duty in the Common Customs Tariff or the
ECSC unified tariff .
</p>
<p>This difference shall be further reduced by 20%
on 1 January 1975 and by 20% on 1 January
1976.
</p>
<p>The new Member States shall apply in full the Com­
mon Customs Tariff and the ECSC unified tariff
from 1 July 1977 .
</p>
<p>2 . The new Member States shall retain the right to
replace a customs duty of a fiscal nature or the fiscal
element of any such duty by an internal tax which is
in conformity with Article 95 of the EEC Treaty. If a
new Mepiber State avails itself of this right, any ele­
ment not so replaced by the internal tax shall consti­
tute the basic duty under Article 31 . This element
shall be abolished in trade within the Community
and brought into line with the Common Customs
Tariff under the conditions laid down in Articles 32,
39 and 59 .
</p>
<p>3 . Where the Commission finds that in a new
Member State there is serious 'difficulty in replacing a
customs duty of a fiscal nature or the fiscal element
of any such duty, it shall authorize that State, follow­
ing a request made before 1 February 1973 , to retain
the duty or fiscal element, provided the State abol­
ishes it by 1 January 1976 at the latest. The decision
of the Commission shall be taken before 1 March
1973 .
</p>
<p>The protective element, the amount of which shall be
fixed by the Commission before 1 March 1973 after
consulting the State concerned, shall constitute the
basic duty provided for in Article 3.1 . This element
shall be abolished in trade within the Community
and brought into line with the Common Customs
Tariff under the conditions laid down in Articles 32 ,
39 and 59 .
</p>
<p>4 . The Commission may authorize the United
Kingdom to retain customs duties of a fiscal nature
or the fiscal element of such duties on tobacco for
two additional years if by 1 January 1976 it has not
proved possible to convert those duties into internal
taxes on manufactured tobacco on a harmonized
basis in accordance with Article 99 of the EEC
Treaty, either because there are no Community pro­
visions in this field on 1 January 1975 or because the
time limit set for the implementation of such Com­
munity provisions is later than 1 January 1976 .
</p>
<p>5 . The Council Directive of 4 March 1969 on the
harmonization of provisions laid down by law, regu­
lation or administrative action for deferred payment
of customs duties, charges having equivalent effect
and agricultural levies shall not apply in the new
Member States to the customs duties of a fiscal nature
referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 or to the fiscal
element of such duties .
</p>
<p>6 . The Council Directive of 4 March 1969 on the
harmonization of provisions laid down by law, regu­
lation ' or administrative action in respect of inward
processing shall not apply in the United Kingdom to
the customs duties of a fiscal nature referred to in
paragraphs 3 and 4 or to the fiscal element of such
duties .
</p>
<p>2 . From 1 January 1974, if any duties in the Com­
mon Customs Tariff are altered or suspended, the
new Member States shall simultaneously amend or
suspend their tariffs in the proportion resulting from
the implementation of paragraph 1 .
</p>
<p>3 . The new Member States shall apply the Com­
mon Customs Tariff from 1 January 1974 in respect
of the products listed in Annex III to this Act.
</p>
<p>4 . The new Member States shall apply the Com­
mon Customs Tariff nomenclature from the date of
accession . Denmark, Norway and the United King­
dom are, however, authorized to defer their appli­
cation of the nomenlcature until 1 January 1974 .
</p>
<p>The new Member States may include within this
nomenclature existing national subdivisions which
are indispensable in order that the progressive align­
ment of their customs duties with those in the Com­
mon Customs Tariff be carried out under the con­
ditions laid down in this Act.
</p>
<p>5 . With a view to facilitating the progressive intro­
duction of the Common Customs Tariff by the new
Member States, the Commission shall determine, if
necessary, the provisions whereby new Member States
alter their customs duties .</p>

table must be the same for the new Member States
and the original Member States .In order to bring their tariffs into line with the Com­
</p>
<p>mon Customs Tariff and the ECSC unified tariff , the
new Member States shall remain free to alter their
customs duties more rapidly than is provided for in
Article 39(1 ) and (3 ). They shall inform the other
Member States and the Commission thereof. CHAPTER 3

trade with third countries shall apply under the same
conditions to trade within the Community, for such
time as customs duties are levied in that trade .
</p>
<p>For the purpose of establishing the customs value in
respect of that trade , the customs territory to be
taken into consideration shall be that defined by the
provisions existing in the Community and in the new
Member States on 31 December 1972
</p>
<p>2 . The Member States shall apply the Common
Customs Tariff nomenclature in trade within the
Community from the date of accession . Denmark,
Norway and the United Kingdom are, however,
authorized to defer their application of this nomen­
clature until 1 January 1974 .

particular, of the special situations which may result
from the implementation for the same goods of rhe
first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and of Article 97 .
</p>
<p>Article 48
</p>
<p>2 . Before the first move towards price alignment
referred to in Article 52, the prices to be applied in
each new Member State shall be fixed in accordance
with the rules provided for in the common organiz­
ation of the market in the sector in question at a level
which allows producers in that sector to obtain
returns equivalent to those obtained under the pre­
vious national system .
</p>
<p>3 . In respect of Norway and the United Kingdom ,
those prices shall , however, be fixed at a level such
that the application of the Community rules results in
a level of market prices comparable with the level
recorded in the Member State concerned during a
representative period preceding the implementation
of the Community rules .
</p>
<p>1 . The provisions of this Title shall not prevent
Ireland from applying to products originating in the
United Kingdom arrangements enabling customs
duties and protective elements contained in customs
duties of a fiscal nature to be eliminated more
rapidly , in accordance with the Anglo-Irish Free
Trade Area Agreement , signed on 14 December 1965,
and related Agreements .
</p>
<p>2 . The provisions adopted pursuant to Article
45(2 ) shall apply from 1 January 1974 in the context
of the customs arrangements in force between Ireland
and the United Kingdom.

</p>
<p>Article 49
</p>
<p>1 - Protocols Nos 8 to 15 annexed to this Act shall
not preclude any alteration to or suspension of duties
decided under Article 28 of the EEC Treaty .
</p>
<p>2 . The Protocols annexed to the Agreement on the
determination of part of the Common Customs Tariff
in respect of the products in List G annexed to the
EEC Treaty are hereby revoked , with the exception
of Protocol No XVII .
</p>
<p>1 . If the application of the provisions of this Title
results in a price level different from that of the com­
mon prices , the prices in respect of which Chapters 2
and 3 refer to this Article shall be aligned with the
level of the common prices in six stages .
</p>
<p>2 . Subject to paragraph 4, the moves towards
alignment shall be carried out each year at the be­
ginning of the marketing year according to the fol­
lowing provisions :
</p>
<p>( a ) when the price of a product in a new Member
State is lower than the common price, the price
in that Member State shall , at the time of each
move towards alignment, be increased success­
ively by a sixth, a fifth, a quarter, a third and a
half of the difference between the price level in
that new Member State and the common price
level which are applicable before each move
towards alignment ; the price resulting from this
calculation shall be increased proportionately to
any rise in the common price for the following
marketing year ;
</p>
<p>( b ) when the price of a product in a new Member
State is higher than the common price, the differ­
ence between the price level applicable before
each move towards alignment in the new Mem­
ber State and the common price level applicable
for the next marketing year shall be reduced suc­
cessively by a sixth, a fifth, a quarter, a third and
a half .
</p>
<p>3 . In the interest of the smooth functioning of the
process of integration , the Council , acting in accord­
ance with the procedure laid down in Article 43(2)
of the EEC Treaty, may decide that, notwithstanding
paragraph 2, the price of one or more products in
one or more of the new Member States shall for one
marketing year depart from the prices resulting from
the application of paragraph 2 .

<p>This departure may not exceed 10% of the amount
of the price move to be made.
</p>
<p>In that event, the price level for the following market­
ing year shall be that which would have resulted
from applying paragraph 2 if the departure had not
been decided upon. A further departure from this
price level may, however, be decided upon for that
marketing year in accordance with the conditions in
the preceding subparagraphs .
</p>
<p>4 . The common prices shall be applied in the new
Member States by 1 January 1978 at the latest.
</p>
<p>Article 53
</p>
<p>If the difference between the price level of a product
in a new Member State and the common price level is
found to be minimal, the Council, acting in accord­
ance with the procedure laid down in Article 43(2)
of the EEC Treaty, may decide that the common
price shall be applied in that new Member State in
respect of the product concerned.

<p>Article 54
</p>
<p>( a ) in trade between the new Member States them­
selves and with the Community as originally
constituted, compensatory amounts shall be levied
by the importing State or granted by the export­
ing State ;
</p>
<p>(b ) in trade between the new Member States and
third countries , levies or other import charges
applied under the common agricultural policy
and export refunds shall be reduced or increased,
as the case may be, by the compensatory
amounts applicable in trade with the Community
as originally constituted . Customs duties may
not, however, be reduced by the compensatory
amount.
</p>
<p>2 . For products in respect of which prices are fixed
in accordance with Articles 51 and 52, the compensa­
tory amounts applicable in trade between the Com­
munity as originally constituted and the new Member
States, and between those States and third countries,
shall be equal to the difference between the prices
fixed for the new Member State concerned and the
common prices .
</p>
<p>For the other products , the compensatory amounts
shall be determined in the cases provided for in
Chapters 2 and 3 and in accordance with the rules
which they lay down.
</p>
<p>3 . The compensatory amounts applicable in trade
between the new Member States shall be determined
by direct reference to the compensatory amounts
fixed for each of those States in accordance with
paragraph 2.
</p>
<p>4 . No compensatory amount shall , however, be
fixed if the application of paragraphs 2 and 3 results
in a minimal amount.
</p>
<p>5 . For products in respect of which the duty in the
Common Customs Tariff is bound under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the binding shall be
taken into account.
</p>
<p>6 . The compensatory amount levied or granted by
a Member State in accordance with paragraph 1(a)
may not exceed the total amount levied by that same
Member State on imports from third countries .
</p>
<p>The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a pro­
posal from the Commission, may derogate from this
rule, in particular in order to avoid deflections of
trade and distortions of competition .
</p>
<p>1 . For such time as there is a difference in the
United Kingdom between prices obtained under the
national system of guaranteed prices and market prices
resulting from the application of the mechanisms
of the common agricultural policy and the provisions
of this Title, that Member State is authorized to
retain production subsidies .
</p>
<p>2. The United Kingdom shall, for each of the pro­
ducts to which paragraph 1 applies, endeavour to
abolish these subsidies as soon as possible during the
period referred to in Article 9(2).
</p>
<p>3 . These subsidies may not have the effect of rais­
ing the returns of producers above the level which
would have resulted from the application to these
returns of the rules for the alignment of prices laid
down in Article 52. •
</p>
<p>4. The Council, acting in accordance with the pro­
cedure laid down in Article 43(2) of the EEC Treaty,

of the Common Customs Tariff, each new Member
State shall reduce the difference between the basic
duty and the duty in the Common Customs Tariff by
successive amounts of 20% . These moves towards
alignment shall be made on the dates laid down in
paragraph 1 for the products in question . For the
products referred to in paragraph 1(c), the moves
towards alignment shall follow the timetable laid
down in Article 39(1 ).
</p>
<p>However, in the case of tariff headings in respect of
which the basic duties do not differ by more than
15% in either direction from the duties in the Com­
mon Customs Tariff, the latter duties shall be applied
from the date of the first move towards alignment for
each category of products in question .
</p>
<p>3 . In respect of the second, third and fourth reduc­
tions or moves towards alignment, the Council ,
acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the
Commission, may decide that, in respect of one or
more of the new Member States , the duties applicable
to one or more of the products referred to in para­
graph 1(b ) shall , for one year, depart from the duties
resulting from the application of paragraph 1 or, as
the case may be, paragraph 2 .
</p>
<p>This departure may not exceed 10% of the amount
of the modification to be made under paragraph 1 or 2.
</p>
<p>In that event, the duties to be applied for the follow­
ing year shall be those which would have resulted
from applying paragraph 1 or, as the case may be,
paragraph 2, if the departure had not been decided
upon . However, for that year, a further departure
from those duties may be decided upon in accordance
with the conditions set out in the above subpara­
graphs .
</p>
<p>On 1 January 1978 , the customs duties on these pro­
ducts shall be abolished and the new Member States
shall apply in full the Common Customs Tariff.

<p>4 . In respect of products covered by a common
organization of the market, the new Member States
may, in accordance with the procedure laid down in
Article 26 of Regulation No 120/67/EEC on the com­
mon organization of the market in cereals or, as the
case may be, laid down in the corresponding Articles
of the other Regulations on the establishment of a
common organization of agricultural markets, be
authorized to abolish the customs duties referred to in
paragraph 1 , or to align duties as provided for in
paragraph s, or both, at a more rapid rate than that
laid down in the preceding paragraphs or to suspend
in whole or in part the customs duties on products
imported from other Member States .
</p>
<p>The following provisions shall apply to products the
importation of which from third countries into the
Community as originally constituted is subject to
customs duties :
</p>
<p>1 . Customs duties on imports shall be progress­
ively abolished between the Community as originally
constituted and the new Member States and between
the new Member States themselves in five stages . The
first reduction, which shall reduce the customs duties
to 80% of the basic duty, and the four other reduc­
tions of 20% each, shall be made in accordance with
the following timetable :
</p>
<p>( a ) for products covered by the common organization
of the market in beef and veal : at the start of
each marketing year, the first reduction taking
place in 1973 ;

<p>1 . The component for protection of the processing
industry which is used in calculating the charge on
imports from third countries of products covered by

rice and products processed from fruit and vegetables
shall be levied on imports from the new Member
States into the Community as originally constituted .
</p>
<p>2 . For imports into the new Member States, the
amount of that component shall be determined by
separating out, from the total protection applied on 1
January 1972, the component or components ' de­
signed to ensure the protection of the processing in­
dustry.
</p>
<p>Such component or components shall be levied on
imports from other Member States ; they shall
replace, as regards the charge on imports from third
countries , the Community protective component.
</p>
<p>3 . Article 59 shall apply to the component referred
to in paragraphs 1 and 2. The reductions or align­
ments in question shall , however, in respect of cereal
and rice products be made at the beginning of the
marketing year fixed for the basic product concerned.

<p>Article 62
</p>
<p>1 - The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a
proposal from the Commission, shall adopt the pro­

</p>
<p>2 . The Council , acting unanimously on a proposal
from the Commission after consulting the Assembly,
may make the necessary adaptations to the provisions
of Chapters 2, 3 and 4 of this Title, if made necessary
as a result of a change in Community rules .
</p>
<p>1 . In respect of products covered, on the date of
accession, by a common organization of the market,
the system applicable in the Community as originally
constituted in respect of customs duties and charges
having equivalent effect and quantitative restrictions
and measures having equivalent effect shall , subject
to Articles 55 and 59 , apply in the new Member
States from 1 February 1973 .
</p>
<p>2 . In respect of products not covered, on the date
of accession, by a common organization of the mar­
ket, the provisions of Title I concerning the progress­
ive abolition of charges having equivalent effect to
customs duties and of quantitative restrictions and
measures having equivalent effect shall not apply to
those charges, restrictions and measures if they form
part of a national market organization on the date of
accession .
</p>
<p>This provision shall apply only to the extent neces­
sary to ensure the maintenance of the national organ­
ization and until the common organization of the
market for these products is implemented .
</p>
<p>3 . The new Member States shall apply the Com­
mon Customs Tariff nomenclature by 1 February
1973 at the latest, in respect of agricultural products
covered by a common organization of the market.
</p>
<p>To the extent that no difficulties arise in the applica­
tion of the Community rules and, in particular, in the
functioning of the common organization of markets
and of the transitional mechanisms provided for in
this Title, the Council, acting by a qualified majority
on a proposal from the Commission, may authorize a
new Member State to include within this nomencla­
ture such existing national subdivisions as would be
indispensable for carrying out the progressive moves
towards alignment with the Common Customs Tariff
or the elimination of the duties in the Community
under the conditions laid down in this Act.
</p>
<p>Article 63
</p>
<p>1 . If transitional measures are necessary to facili­
tate the passage from the existing arrangements in the
new Member States to those resulting from the appli­
cation of the common organization of the markets as
provided for in this Title, particularly if for certain
products the implementation of the new arrange­
ments on the scheduled date meets with appreciable
difficulties, such measures shall be adopted in accor­
dance with the procedure provided for in Article 26
of Regulation No 120/67/EEC or, as the case may be,
in the corresponding Articles of the other Regulations
on the common organization of agricultural markets .
Such, measures may be taken during the period up to</p>

to the difference between the prices referred to in
Article 65(1 ) ( c ).
</p>
<p>In trade between two new Member States in which
the conditions referred to in Article 65(1 ) are ful­
filled , the compensatory amount shall be equal to the
difference between their respective producer prices .
The compensatory amount shall not be applied if this
difference is insignificant .

<p>1 he differences referred to in the above subpara­
graphs shall be adjusted , to the extent necessary , by
the incidence of customs duties .

fixed , the compensatory amount shall be reduced by
one fifth of the original amount on 1 January every
year, beginning on 1 January 1974 .

<p>3 . Each year an autonomous nil duty Community
tariff quota shall be opened when it has been estab­
lished that all possibilities of supply on the internal
market of the Community will be exhausted during
the period for which the quota is opened .
</p>
<p>1 . The definition of newsprint (CCT subheading
No 48.01 A) shall be amended in such a way as to
reduce the lower weight limit from 48 to 40 grammes
per square metre.
</p>
<p>2 . The nil duty tariff quota of 625,000 metric tons
bound under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade will be reduced .

<p>on unwrought lead
(CCT subheading No 78.01 A)
</p>
<p>1 . In respect of argentiferous lead defined as fol­
lows :
</p>
<p>78.01 A I Unwrought lead containing not less than
0.02% silver, intended for refining (ar­
gentiferous lead)
</p>
<p>a nil duty Community tariff quota shall be opened
until the entry into force of a total suspension, for an
indefinite period, of the duty on argentiferous lead .
The new Member States shall participate in this tariff
quota from 1 January 1974. Its annual volume shall
be equal to the total of the applications made by the
Member States concerned, plus a reserve.
</p>
<p>This Community tariff quota shall be administered
according to a system which makes it possible to
ensure that the argentiferous lead thus imported is in
fact refined by those to whom it is allocated.
</p>
<p>2. Argentiferous lead shall be subject to an ad
valorem duty of 4.5% .
</p>
<p>3 . The autonomous duty on argentiferous lead
shall be suspended at a level of 2% from 1 January
1975 .
</p>
<p>4. The Council shall review annually the possi­
bility of a total suspension, for an indefinite period,
of the autonomous duty on argentiferous lead.
</p>
<p>5 . With regard to unwrought lead other than
argentiferous lead the following measures shall be
applied :
</p>
<p>( a ) on 1 January 1974, the present duty of 1.32 ua/
100 kg shall be altered to an ad valorem duty of
4.5% with a minimum charge of 1.1 ua/100 kg;
</p>
<p>(b ) from 1 January 1974, the new Member States
shall participate in the nil duty Community tariff
quota of 55,000 metric tons for unwrought lead
other than argentiferous lead. From 1975
onwards, the volume will decrease in order to
achieve the abolition of the quota by 31 Decem­
ber 1977;
</p>
<p>(c) before the quota is abolished, the Council shall
examine the situation with a view to deciding on
a possible reduction of the autonomous duty on
unwrought lead other than argentiferous lead, it
being understood that the duty thus reduced
must include a minimum charge of 1.1 ua/100
kg.</p>

<p>Protocol No 16
</p>
<p>on markets and trade in agricultural products
</p>
<p>during the period of application of the transitional
measures to meet, when the time comes, problems
which may arise for certain third countries and in
certain specific cases ( 1 ).
</p>
<p>If such problems do arise, the " institutions will ex­
amine the specific cases in the light of all the factors
relevant to the situation at the time, just as they have
done hitherto in similar cases ; and during the period
of application of the transitional measures they will ,
in so far as is necessary, have to take measures likely
to solve these problems, in accordance with the prin­
ciples of the common agricultural policy and within
the framework of its mechanisms .
</p>
<p>6. In order to overcome difficulties which may
arise on the Community markets from the appli­
cation of the transitional mechanisms, the institutions
of the Community have available and will , where
necessary, make use of the various means of action
stemming from the provisions of the EEC Treaty,
from the acts taken in implementing that Treaty and
from the provisions of this Act.
</p>
<p>1 . The application by the new Member States of
the Community agricultural rules, combined with the
transitional measures provided for in Title II of Part
Four in the Act of Accession will, from the time of
application of those provisions, result in the exten­
sion to the whole of the Community of Community
preference for agricultural products .
</p>
<p>2 . The organization of the markets has as its
essential feature to enable intra-Community trade to
develop in conditions comparable with those existing
on an internal market.
</p>
<p>3 . The geographical extension of the Community
may, however, give rise to problems which should be
avoided concerning fluidity of trade, particularly in
the cereals sector (wheat and rice).
</p>
<p>The institutions of the Community shall , on appli­
cation of the regulations on the common organization
of the markets, ensure that the free circulation of all
products is guaranteed in accordance with the objec­
tives set out in the EEC Treaty and in the regulations
concerned .
</p>
<p>4. Changes in the structure of international trade
constitute a natural result of the enlargement of the
Community.
</p>
<p>5 . While respecting the provisions of Articles 39
and 110 of the EEC Treaty, it should be possible
</p>
<p>(') The Conference between the European Communities and the States
which applied for accession to these Communities noted, at its meet­
ings with the United Kingdom on 11/ 12 May 1971 , with Ireland on 7
June 1971 , with Norway on 21 June 1971 , and with Denmark on 12
July 1971 , that these specific cases " in so far as can be foreseen at pre­
sent will be confined to butter, sugar, bacon and certain fruit and veg­
etables".</p>

</p>
<p>Protocol No 17
</p>
<p>on the import of sugar by the United Kingdom from the exporting countries and territories
referred to in the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement
</p>
<p>1 . Until 28 February 1975 , the United Kingdom is
authorized to import from the exporting countries
and territories referred to in the Commonwealth
Sugar Agreement, on the following terms, quantities
of sugar within the negotiated price quotas under
that Agreement.
</p>
<p>2 . The following shall be charged at the time of
importation :
</p>
<p>( a ) a special levy, equal to the difference between the
c.i.f. equivalent of the agreed purchase price and
the price at which the sugar is marketed in the
United Kingdom. Article 55(l)(b ) of the Act of
Accession shall not apply ;
</p>
<p>(b ) a charge based on the difference between the
world c.i.f. price of raw sugar and the c.i.f. equiv­
alent of the agreed purchase price ; this charge
will be used to finance the costs involved in the
re-selling of the sugar by the United Kingdom
Sugar Board.
</p>
<p>However, if the world c.i.f. price of raw sugar
exceeds the c.i.f. equivalent of the agreed pur­
</p>
<p>chase price, the Board shall pay the difference to
the importer.
</p>
<p>3 . The price at which the sugar in question is mar­
keted in the United Kingdom shall be fixed at a level
such as to allow the quantities in question effectively
to be marketed without prejudicing the marketing of
Community sugar.
</p>
<p>4. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 15(1 )
of Regulation (EEC) No 766/68 laying down general
rules for the grant of export refunds for sugar, the
export refund applicable in the United Kingdom may
be granted for white sugar produced from raw sugar
imported under the terms of this Protocol .
</p>
<p>5 . The Council shall , acting by a qualified ma­
jority on a proposal from the Commission, adopt the
measures necessary for implementing the provisions
of this Protocol in such a way as to ensure the proper
functioning of the common organization of the mar­
ket in sugar and in particular to ensure that, in the
application of the provisions laid down in paragraph
2, the price at which the sugar is marketed in the
United Kingdom is respected.

<p>Protocol No 18
</p>
<p>on the import of New Zealand butter and cheese into the United Kingdom
</p>
<p>Article 1 (b ) in respect of cheese :
</p>
<p>1 . The United Kingdom is authorized, as a transi­
tional arrangement, to import from New Zealand
certain quantities of butter and cheese, on the follow­
ing terms.
</p>
<p>2. The quantities referred to in paragraph 1 shall
be :
</p>
<p>( a) in respect of butter, for the first five years :
</p>
<p>1973 165,811 metric tons
1974 158,902 metric tons
1975 151,994 metric tons
1976 145,085 metric tons
1977 138,176 metric tons
</p>
<p>1973 68,580 metric tons
</p>
<p>1974 60,960 metric tons
</p>
<p>1975 45,720 metric tons
</p>
<p>1976 30,480 metric tons
</p>
<p>1977 15,240 metric tons
</p>
<p>The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a pro­
posal from the Commission, may make adjustments
between those quantities of butter and cheese, pro­
vided that the tonnage expressed as milk equivalent
corresponding to the total quantities laid down for
those two products for the year in question remains
unaltered .</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>174 Official journal of the European Communities 27 . 3 . 72
</p>
<p>Article 4
</p>
<p>The Community shall continue its efforts to promote
the conclusion of an international agreement on milk
products so that, as soon as possible , conditions on
the world market may be improved .
</p>
<p>3 . The quantities of butter and cheese specified in
paragraph 2 shall be imported into the United King­
dom at a price the observance of which must be
guaranteed at the c.i.f. stage by New Zealand . That
price shall be fixed at a level which enables New Zea­
land to realize a price representing the average price
obtained by that country on the United Kingdom
market during 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972 .
</p>
<p>4. The products imported into the United King­
dom in accordance with the provisions of this Proto­
col may not become the subject of intra-Community
trade or of re-exportation to third countries .
</p>
<p>Article 5
</p>
<p>Article 2
</p>
<p>1 . The Council shall , during 1975, review the
situation as regards butter in the light of prevailing
conditions and of supply and demand developments
in the major producing and consuming countries of
the world, particularly in the Community and in
New Zealand . During that review, among the con­
siderations to be taken into account shall be the
following :
</p>
<p>( a ) progress towards an effective world agreement on
milk products, to which the Community and
other important producing and consuming coun­
tries would be parties ;
</p>
<p>(b ) the extent of New Zealand's progress towards
diversification of its economy and exports, it
being understood that the Community will strive
to pursue a commercial policy which does not
run counter to this progress .
</p>
<p>2 . Appropriate measures to ensure the mainten­
ance after 31 December 1977 of exceptional arrange­
ments in respect of imports of butter from New
Zealand, including the details of such arrangements,
shall be determined by the Council, acting unani­
mously on a proposal from the Commission, in the
light of that review.
</p>
<p>3 . After 31 December 1977, the exceptional ar­
rangements laid down for imports of cheese may no
longer be retained.
</p>
<p>1 . Special levies shall be applied to imports into
the United Kingdom of the quantities of butter and
cheese specified in Article 1 .. Article 55(l)(b ) of the
Act of Accession shall not be applicable.
</p>
<p>2 . The special levies shall be fixed on the basis of
the c.i.f. price referred to in Article 1(3 ) and of the
market price of the products in question within the
United Kingdom, at a level such as to allow the
quantities of butter and cheese to be effectively mar­
keted without prejudicing the marketing of Com­
munity butter and cheese.
</p>
<p>Article 3
</p>
<p>The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a pro­
posal from the Commission, shall adopt the measures
necessary for implementing Articles 1 and 2 .
</p>
<p>Protocol No 19
</p>
<p>on spirituous beverages obtained from cereals
</p>
<p>1 . The Council , acting in accordance with the pro­
cedure provided for in Article 43(2) of the EEC
Treaty, shall decide the necessary measures to facili­
tate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture
of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals, and in
particular of whisky, exported to third countries, so
that these measures may be applied in due time.
</p>
<p>2. These measures, which may be taken within the
framework of the Regulation on the common organ­
ization of the market in cereals or of the regulation to
be adopted on the common organization of the mar­
ket in alcohol must fit into the framework of the gen­
eral Community policy for alcohol, avoiding any
discrimination between these products and other
alcohol, account being taken of the particular situ­
ations peculiar to each case.</p>

<p>27.3.72 Official Journal of the European Communities 175
</p>
<p>Protocol No 20
</p>
<p>on Norwegian agriculture
</p>
<p>THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES , 3 . The problem of Norwegian subsidies for trans­
port costs, which are intended to compensate for the
particularly unfavourable effects of the long distances
between production areas and natural outlets and
the fact that agricultural regions are widely dispersed,
must be adequately resolved by applying the pro­
visions of the EEC Treaty.
</p>
<p>4 . A support system shall be introduced in Nor­
way which should permit the maintenance of the far­
mers ' standard of living. Support shall be given in so
far as is necessary for achieving this objective . The
support may not be linked with the product sold, nor
include subsidies in respect of producer prices, and
this will require changes in the support measures cur­
rently in force in Norway. The support shall be
varied according to the regions and the categories of
farmers concerned . The measures to be taken shall be
adapted to the various types of production .
</p>
<p>Desiring to solve the problems which the accession of
Norway to the European Economic Community cre­
ates for the farmers of that country ;
</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the anxieties expressed by
the Norwegian Government concerning the fact that
Norway's agriculture is at a disadvantage as regards
production owing to the country's geographical posi­
tion and configuration ; that the same factors deter­
mine the particular demographic problems of Nor­
way and involve, for the agricultural holdings of that
country, relatively high production costs , which have
necessitated a general system of support measures for
the purpose of maintaining a balanced social struc­
ture, and an equitable standard of living for the agri­
cultural population ;
</p>
<p>Recognize the particular problems which the acces­
sion of Norway to the European Economic Com­
munity creates for the farmers of that country, particu­
larly in view of the fact that a simple alignment of
the prices received by Norwegian producers with the
level of Community prices would cause a substantial
loss in earnings , with unfavourable consequences
from the demographic and social point of view ;
</p>
<p>Recognize in particular that the transitional period
could not solve these problems and that it is there­
fore necessary to envisage specific arrangements—
which should not be regarded as constituting a prece­
dent—with the object of maintaining the standard of
living of Norwegian farmers, in compliance with the
rules governing the common agricultural policy ;
</p>
<p>5 . Norway shall have the option of maintaining
until 31 December 1975 , by way of derogation, the
subsidies granted at present. Producer price subsidies
shall be reduced by amounts corresponding to the in­
creases in market prices resulting from the alignment
of these market prices with the level of the common
prices .
</p>
<p>HAVE AGREED THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS :
</p>
<p>6 . In the horticultural sector and for potatoes ,
Norway is authorized until 31 December 1977, by
way of derogation, to replace quantitative restrictions
on imports by provisions making it possible to main­
tain, for certain products, a price level comparable to
the price ruling on the Norwegian market before
accession . These provisions shall constitute a system
of minimum prices to be fixed on the Norwegian
market below which countervailing charges may be
applied to imports from any source ; ' as regards
imports of these products intended for processing, the
countervailing charge may be suspended, whereas for
deliveries of home-grown products intended for pro­
cessing a refund corresponding to the amount of this
charge may be granted. The transitional provisions
agreed for customs duties shall continue to apply.
</p>
<p>The Council , acting by a qualified majority on a pro­
posal from the Commission, shall adopt the measures
necessary for implementing the provisions of this
paragraph.
</p>
<p>1 . Subject to the temporary derogations referred to
in the following paragraphs, the system applied to
Norwegian agriculture must be devised in such a way
as not to compromise the functioning of the common
agricultural policy, and particularly of the common
organization of markets, throughout the Colnmunity.
</p>
<p>2 . Norway shall apply the Community's agricul­
tural rules in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the Act of Accession.</p>
<p />
</div>

<p>176 Official Tournal of the European Communities 27. 3 . 72
</p>
<p>ance with the provisions of the EEC Treaty with a
view to putting into operation, upon expiry of the
periods provided for in paragraphs 5 and 6, the sup­
port system in accordance with paragraph 4.
</p>
<p>9 . Under Community supervision, and without
prejudice to the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 8 ,
appropriate measures shall be taken in Norway to
ensure a supply of milk which is sufficient regularly
to meet the liquid milk consumption of the popu­
lation, and in such a way that the present high level of
milk consumption is not endangered . The Council
shall , according to the procedure of Article 43(2 ) of
the EEC Treaty, adopt the provisions necessary to
this end, which may include subsidies .
</p>
<p>7 . ' For products in the pigmeat, eggs and poultry
sectors, the compensatory amount applicable to
imports into Norway until the first reduction shall be
calculated, notwithstanding Articles 75, 77, and 79 of
the Act of Accession, on the basis of the difference
between the prices for slaughtered pigs, eggs in shell
and slaughtered poultry on the Norwegian market,
on the one hand, and on the market of the Com­
munity as originally constituted and of each of the
other new Member States , on the other.
</p>
<p>The compensatory amount referred to in the first
subparagraph shall be reduced by . a quarter on 1
November 1973 , a quarter on 1 November 1974, a
quarter on 1 November 1975 and abolished on 1
November 1976, without prejudice to the application
after this date of Articles 75 , 77 and 79 of the Act of
Accession .
</p>
<p>The Council shall , acting by a qualified majority on a
proposal from the Commission, adopt the measures
necessary for implementing the provisions of this
paragraph.
</p>
<p>8 . By 30 June 1974 at the latest, and in respect of
horticulture and potatoes by 30 June 1976 at the
latest, the Commission shall make proposals to the
Council including, if appropriate, proposals on ex­
penditure eligible for Community financing in accord­
</p>
<p>10. If any subsequent development of the common
agricultural policy or of other Community policies
should include Community measures enabling a total
or a partial solution of the special problems of Nor­
wegian agriculture, those Community measures, and
any possible Community financing, would replace the
specific measures taken in Norway.
</p>
<p>11 . The institutions of the Community shall
periodically review the conditions and procedures for
implementing the arrangements applied in Norway.
</p>
<p>Protocol No 21
</p>
<p>on the fisheries regime for Norway
</p>
<p>THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES , country which are essentially dependent on inshore
fishing, and sharing the objectives of the Norwegian
Government in this field,Recognizing the very gteat importance of the fishing

<p>industry for Norway,
</p>
<p>Confirm that, within the framework of Article 101 of
the Act of Accession, Norway is authorized to limit
fishing in those waters which come under its sov­
ereignty or jurisdiction, situated within a limit of
twelve nautical miles, between Egersund and the
frontier between Norway and the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics,
</p>
<p>Considering that, because of the special geographical
situation of Norway, fisheries and the industries con­
nected therewith constitute an essential activity for
the population of a large part of the coastal areas
where other possibilities of employment are limited,
</p>
<p>Conscious of the importance, both for Norway and
for the Community as a whole, of maintaining a
satisfactory demographic balance in the areas of this
</p>
<p>Agree to recommend the institutions of the Com­

<p>sion, of the problems facing Norway in the field of
fisheries, both in the context of its general economy
and for reasons stemming from the particular demo­

</p>
<p>I pate side by side with the Associated African and
Malagasy States in negotiating the new Convention
to follow the Convention signed on 29 July 1969 .
</p>
<p>3 . In the event of Botswana, Lesotho or Swaziland
choosing one of the first two formulae contained in
the offer :
</p>
<p>— appropriate solutions must be found for the speci­
fic problems arising from the special circumstances
of these countries , which are in a customs union
with a third country ;
</p>
<p>— the Community must, in the territory of those
States, enjoy tariff treatment not less favourable
than that applied by those States to the most­
favoured third country ;
</p>
<p>— the provisions of the system applied, and particu­
larly the rules of origin must be such as to avoid
any risk of trade deflection to the detriment of the
Community resulting from the participation of
those States in a customs .union with a third
country.
</p>
<p>1 . The European Economic Community shall offer
the independent Commonwealth countries listed in
Annex VI to the Act of Accession the possibility of
ordering their relations with the Community in the
spirit of the Declaration of Intent adopted by the
Council at its meeting held on 1/2 April 1963 , accord­
ing to one of the following formulae at their choice .
— participation in the Convention of Association
which, upon the expiry of the Convention of
Association signed on 29 July 1969, will govern
relations between the Community and the Associ­
ated African and Malagasy States which signed
the latter Convention ;
</p>
<p>— the conclusion of one or more special conventions
of association on the basis of Article 238 of the
EEC Treaty comprising reciprocal rights and obli­
gations, particularly in the field of trade;
</p>
<p>— the conclusion of trade agreements with a view to
facilitating and developing trade between the
Community and those countries .
</p>
<p>2. For practical reasons, the Community desires
that the independent Commonwealth countries to
which its offer is addressed, should take up a position
with respect to this offer as soon as possible after
accession .
</p>
<p>The Community proposes to the independent Com­
monwealth countries listed in Annex VI to the Act of
Accession that the negotiations envisaged for the con­
clusion of agreements based on one of the formulae
contained in the offer should begin as from 1 August
1973 .
</p>
<p>The Community accordingly invites the independent
Commonwealth countries which choose to negotiate
within the framework of the first formula to partici­
</p>
<p>II
</p>
<p>1 . As regards the association arrangements to be
made on the expiry of the Convention of Association
signed on 29 July 1969 , the Community is ready to
pursue its policy of association both with regard to
the Associated African and Malagasy States and with
regard to the independent developing Commonwealth
countries which become parties to the same associ­
ation.
</p>
<p>2. The accession of the new Member States to the
Community and the possible extension of the policy
of association should not be the source of any</p>

<p>178 Official Journal of the European Communities 27 . 3 . 72
</p>
<p>ditions common to the independent developing Com­
monwealth countries situated in Africa, the Indian
Ocean, the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean, and the
Associated African and Malagasy States, the experi­
ence acquired within the framework of association,
the wishes of the Associated States and the conse­
quences for those States of the introduction of the gen­
eralized preference scheme.
</p>
<p>weakening in the Community's relations with the
Associated African and Malagasy States which are
parties to the Convention of Association signed on
29 July 1969 .
</p>
<p>The Community's relations with the Associated Afri­
can and Malagasy States ensure for those States a
range of advantages and are based on structures
which give the Association its distinctive character in
the fields of trade relations, financial and technical
cooperation and joint institutions.
</p>
<p>3 . The Community's objective in its policy of associ­
ation shall remain the safeguarding of what has
been achieved and of the fundamental principles
referred to above.
</p>
<p>Ill
</p>
<p>The Community will have as its firm purpose the
safeguarding of the interests of all the countries re­
ferred to in this Protocol whose economies depend to a
considerable extent on the export of primary pro­
ducts, and particularly of sugar.
</p>
<p>The question of sugar will be settled within this
framework, bearing in mind with regard to exports of
sugar the importance of this product for the econ­
omies of several of these countries and of the Com­
monwealth countries in particular.
</p>
<p>4. The provisions of this association, which will be
defined during the negotiations referred to in the
third subparagraph in Part 1(2) of this Protocol, must
similarly take account of the special economic con­
</p>
<p>Protocol No 23
</p>
<p>on the application by the new Member States of the generalized tariff preference scheme
applied by the European Economic Community
</p>
<p>1 . The new Member States are authorized to defer
until 1 January 1974 the application of the general­
ized tariff preference scheme applied by the European
Economic Community to products originating in the
developing countries .
</p>
<p>2. However, in respect of products falling under
Regulations (EEC) Nos 2796/71 , 2797/71 , 2798/71
and 2799/71 , Ireland is authorized until 31 December
1975 to apply, vis-a-vis countries benefiting from ge­
neralized preferences, customs duties equal to the
duties applied in respect of the same products vis-a­
vis Member States other than the United Kingdom.

<p>EXCHANGE OF LETTERS ON MONETARY QUESTIONS
</p>
<p>Brussels , 22 January 1972
</p>
<p>Your Excellency,
</p>
<p>1 . At the Ministerial Meeting of the Conference on 7 June 1971 , it was agreed that the
declaration on monetary questions which I made at the Meeting should form the subject
of an exchange of letters annexed to the Act concerning the Conditions of Accession and
the Adjustments to the Treaties . I therefore now have the honour to confirm that at that
Meeting I made the following declaration :
</p>
<p>"(a) We are prepared to envisage an orderly and gradual run-down of official sterling
balances after our accession .
</p>
<p>(b) We shall be ready to discuss after our entry into the Communities what measures
might be appropriate to achieve a progressive alignment of the external character­
istics and practices in relation to sterling with those of other currencies in the
Community in the context of progress towards economic and monetary union in
the enlarged Community, and we are confident that official sterling (*) can be
handled in a way which will enable us to take our full part in that progress .
</p>
<p>(c) In the meantime we shall manage our policies with a view to stabilizing the official
sterling balances in a way which would be consistent with these longer term ob­
jectives .
</p>
<p>(d) I hope that the Community will regard this statement as disposing satisfactorily of
the question of sterling and associated matters , leaving only the arrangements for
UK compliance with the Directives relating to capital movements under the Treaty
of Rome to be settled in the course of the negotiations."
</p>
<p>2 . At the same meeting on 7 June, the above declaration was agreed by the Community
delegation .
</p>
<p>3 . I understand that the delegations of the Kingdom of Denmark, Ireland and the King­
dom of Norway have also signified their agreement to the above-mentioned declaration as
confirmed by the present letter .

<p>Joint Declaration
</p>
<p>on the Court of Justice
</p>
<p>Such additional measures as may prove necessary fol­
lowing the accession of the new Member States
should be taken by the Council which, at the request
of the Court, may increase the number of Advocates­
General to four and adjust the provisions of the third
</p>
<p>paragraph of Article 32 of the ECSC Treaty , the third
paragraph of Article 165 of the EEC Treaty and the
third paragraph of Article 137 of the Euratom Treaty
accordingly .
</p>
<p>Joint Declaration
</p>
<p>on the Sovereign Base Areas of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
in Cyprus
</p>
<p>The arrangements applicable to relations between the
European Economic Community and the Sovereign
Base Areas of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
</p>
<p>and Northern Ireland in Cyprus will be defined with­
in the context of any agreement between that Com­
munity and the Republic of Cyprus .
</p>
<p>Joint Declaration
on the fisheries sector
</p>
<p>1 . The institutions of the European Economic
Community will examine the problems of the fish
meal and fish oils sector with a view to adopting
measures which might prove necessary in that sector
with respect to the raw material used . These measures
should meet the need for protection and rational use
of the sea 's biological resources while avoiding the
creation or retention of insufficiently profitable pro­
duction units .
</p>
<p>2 . The application of common marketing standards
for certain fresh or chilled fish must not have
the effect of excluding any marketing method and,
conversely, no marketing method should hinder the
application of the said standards ; it is in this spirit
</p>
<p>that the problems which could arise may be settled
when the time comes by the institutions of the Euro­
pean Economic Community .
</p>
<p>3 . The European Economic Community is aware
of the importance of Norwegian exports of fish pro­
ducts to third countries , which are subject like other
Community exports to Regulation (EEC) No
2142/70 .
</p>
<p>4 . It is understood that the Norwegian law on "the
marketing of fish corning from processing industries"
of 18 December 1970 will be the subject, as soon as
possible, of a detailed study with a view to examining
the conditions under which it might be applied ,
having regard to the provisions of Community law.</p>

<p>Joint Declaration of Intent
</p>
<p>on the development of trade relations with Ceylon, India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Singapore
</p>
<p>Inspired by the will to extend and strengthen the
trade relations with the developing independent '
Commonwealth countries in Asia (Ceylon, India,
Malaysia, Pakistan and Singapore), the European
Economic Community is ready, from the date of
accession , to examine with these countries such prob­
lems as may arise in the field of trade with a view to
seeking appropriate solutions, taking into account the
effect of the generalized tariff preference scheme and
the situation of the other developing countries in the
same geographical area .
</p>
<p>The question of exports of sugar from India to the
Community after the expiry of the Commonwealth
Sugar Agreement on 31 December 1971 must be settled
by the Community in the light of this Declaration
of Intent, taking account of the provisions which may
be adopted as regards imports of sugar from the in­
dependent Commonwealth countries listed in Proto­
col No 22 on relations between the European Econ­
omic Community and the Associated African and
Malagasy States and also the independent developing
Commonwealth countries situated in Africa, the
Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean.
</p>
<p>Joint Declaration
on the free movement of workers
</p>
<p>The enlargement of the Community could give rise to
certain difficulties for the social situation in one or
more Member States as regards the application of the
provisions relating to the free movement of workers .
</p>
<p>The Member States declare that they reserve the
</p>
<p>right, should difficulties of that nature arise, to bring
the matter before the institutions of the Community in
order to obtain a solution to this problem in accord­
ance with the provisions of the Treaties establishing
the European Communities and the provisions adop­
ted in application thereof.
</p>
<p>Declaration

<p>Energy Community
</p>
<p>accession of the above-mentioned countries to the
European Economic Community and to the Euro­
pean Atomic Energy Community, that the Decision
of the Council of 22 January 1972 concerning accession
to the European Coal and Steel Community and the

<p>Declaration
</p>
<p>by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the
definition of the term "nationals"
</p>
<p>At the time of signature of the Treaty of Accession ,
the Government of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland make the following
Declaration :
</p>
<p>"As to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, the terms "nationals", "nation­
als of Member States" or "nationals of Member

<p>( a ) persons who are citizens of the United King­
dom and Colonies or British subjects not pos­
sessing that citizenship or the citizenship of
any other Commonwealth country or terri­
tory, who, in either case, have the right of
abode in the United Kingdom, and are there­
fore exempt from United Kingdom immi­
gration control ;
</p>
<p>(b ) persons who are citizens of the United King­
dom and Colonies by birth or by registration
or naturalization in Gibraltar, or whose
father was so born, registered or naturalized."
</p>
<p>Declarations
</p>
<p>on the economic and industrial development of Ireland
</p>
<p>At the 6th Ministerial Meeting in the negotiations
between the Community and Ireland, held on 19
October 1971 , Mr. A. Moro, Minister of Foreign
Affairs of the Italian Republic, made, on behalf of the
Community delegation, the declaration appearing
under I hereinafter.
</p>
<p>Mr. P.J. Hillery, Minister for Foreign Affairs of
Ireland, replied, on behalf of the Irish delegation,
with the declaration appearing under II hereinafter .
</p>
<p>has asked the Community to undertake to employ its
means to support the Irish Government's programmes
aimed at eliminating these imbalances and to take
full account of Ireland's special problems in this
field in the development of a major Community
regional policy at a later date.
</p>
<p>2 . The Irish delegation has submitted documents
to the Community delegation indicating the general
direction and the instruments of the Irish regional
programmes. The Irish delegation has also explained
how the Irish exporting industries are supported by
tax relief. In this respect it is also a question of
measures the aim of which is to do away with econ­
omic and social imbalances by the development of in­
dustry .
</p>
<p>I. Declaration made by Mr. A. Moro, Minister of
Foreign Affairs of the Italian Republic on behalf of
the Community delegation
</p>
<p>I
</p>
<p>II1 . The Irish delegation has stressed that the Irish
Government is faced with serious economic and
social imbalances of a regional and structural nature.
This delegation has stated that these imbalances
should be remedied in order to achieve a degree of
harmonization consistent with the objectives of the
Community and particularly with the realization of
economic and monetary union. The Irish delegation
</p>
<p>1 . The Community delegation emphasizes in this
connection that—as follows from the Preamble to
the Treaty of Rome—the essential objectives of the
Community consist in the constant improvement of
the living and working conditions of the peoples of
the Member States, and the harmonious development</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>27. 3 . 72 Official Journal of the European Communities 197
</p>
<p>of the economies of these States by reducing the dif­
ferences existing between the various regions and the
backwardness of the less-favoured regions .
</p>
<p>Ireland which has been the subject of discussions be­
tween our two delegations and the background to
which has been so clearly set out in your introduc­
tory statement. The text adopted will enable the Irish
Government to proceed with their plans for econ­
omic and social development in the knowledge that
the Community, through its institutions and agencies ,
will be ready to cooperate with us in the pursuit of
the objectives which we have set ourselves .
</p>
<p>2 . The common policies and the various instru­
ments created by the Community in the economic and
social sectors are a positive realization of the above­
mentioned objectives and are furthermore likely to
develop . The European Social Fund has been directed
along new lines . The European Investment Bank is
constantly expanding the field of its activities . At the
present time, the institutions of the Community are
engaged in discussions to decide the Community in­
struments , which it is possible to introduce, and
according to what procedures , in order to achieve the
objectives of the regional policy.
</p>
<p>The aids granted by the States, including those gran­
ted by way of tax exemptions, are subject to the rules
laid down in Articles 92 to 94 of the EEC Treaty .
With regard to State aids for regional purposes it
should be stressed that, under the terms of Article
92(3 ) ( a) "aid to promote the economic development
of areas where the standard of living is abnormally
low or where there is serious under-employment"
may be considered to be compatible with the com­
mon market. Experience shows that this provision is
flexible enough for the Community authorities to be
able to take into consideration the special require­
ments of the underdeveloped regions .
</p>
<p>Tax exemptions—in common with all other aids
existing in Ireland at the time of accession—will be
studied by the Commission in the normal framework
of the permanent examination of existing aids . If this
examination were to reveal that it would not be
possible to retain any particular aid in its existing
form, it will fall to the Commission under the rules
of the Treaty to establish the appropriate time limits
and transitional procedures .
</p>
<p>I have on a number of occasions in the course of the
negotiations, drawn attention to the problems posed
by differences in the level of economic development
in an entity such as the enlarged Community. I have
endeavoured also to explain to you the difficulties
which a country such as Ireland, situated on the peri­
phery of the enlarged Community, must overcome in
order to approximate its level of economic develop­
ment to that of the other Member States . I am fully
aware of the Community's will and purpose to
achieve the aims set out in the EEC Treaty of ensur­
ing the constant improvement of the living and work­
ing conditions of the peoples of the Member States
and the harmonious development of their economies .
The Protocol on which we have reached agreement
today is a convincing demonstration of the Com­
munity's determination to give real content to these
fundamental aims . This Protocol will be an instrument
of practical value in enabling my country to play a
full part within the enlarged Community in achieving
these aims . Its effectiveness for this purpose will be
greatly enhanced by the development of a compre­
hensive Community regional policy. In this connec­
tion may I say that I am heartened by the efforts
being made to deal with this important issue as part
of the evolution of the Community.
</p>
<p>In Irish circumstances , the effectiveness of develop­
ment measures, whether at the national or at Com­
munity level, must be judged by progress in the
reduction of unemployment and emigration and the
raising of living standards . This is essentially a matter
of providing for our growing work force the neces­
sary job opportunities without which a substantial
proportion of our most valuable economic resource
will remain unused or be lost through emigration and
the pace of economic development will be retarded
</p>
<p>3 . Having regard to the above-mentioned special
problems with which Ireland is confronted, the Com­
munity delegation proposes to annex to the Act of
Accession a protocol on the economic and industrial
development of Ireland .
</p>
<p>My Government will be gratified that our discussions
today have shown that Ireland's accession to the
Community will enable them to maintain the drive
towards the realization of their aims as recited in the
Protocol . I have particularly in mind here the con­
tinuing growth of industry which is central to our
general aim of economic expansion . It is of vital
importance to us that progress in this area be main­
tained through the application of effective measures
</p>
<p>II . Declaration made by Mr. P.J. Hillery, Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Ireland, on behalf of the Irish
delegation
</p>
<p>I am pleased to record the Irish delegation's accept­
ance of the text of the proposed Protocol concerning</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>198 Official Journal of the European Communities 27 . 3 . 72
</p>
<p>of industrial promotion . I understand that, like any
other incentive scheme, our industrial incentives will
come up for examination under Community rules
after accession . I note with satisfaction that you rec­
ognise the necessity for an incentive policy in Ire­
land but that questions may arise about the particular
forms our scheme of incentives has taken while we
have been outside the Community .
</p>
<p>I would like to draw your attention to the fact that
the question would arise in this connection of the
commitments which we had previously entered into .
We shall , of course, have to honour these commit­
ments but we shall be ready to discuss in all its
aspects the change-over to whatever new incentive
system is devised and we shall collaborate in solving
these problems in an appropriate way.
</p>
<p>I am fully satisfied from what you have said about
the flexible nature of the relevant Treaty provisions
</p>
<p>that in the examination of our incentives the Com­
munity institutions will take full account of our
special problems . I am also satisfield in the light of the
identity of aims of both the Irish Government and the
Community that if adjustment of these incentives is
called for, the Irish Government will be able to main­
tain the growth of Irish industry, and achieve a con­
tinuous improvement in the level of employment and
living standards .
</p>
<p>Finally, may I say in conclusion that I appreciate the
sympathy and understanding which the Community
has shown in its approach to and examination of the
questions of our regional problems and industrial in­
centives which are of the greatest importance to my
country . The agreement which we have reached
augurs well for our future cooperation within the
enlarged Community in pursuit of the fundamental
aims of the Treaty . I see in this future cooperation
the means by which we in Ireland can best achieve
our national economic objectives .
</p>
<p>Declarations
</p>
<p>on liquid milk, pigmeat and eggs
</p>
<p>At the 2nd Ministerial Meeting in the negotiations
between the Community and the United Kingdom
held on 27 October 1970, Mr. G. Rippon, Chancellor
of the Duchy of Lancaster, speaking on behalf of the
United Kingdom delegation, and Mr. W. Scheel , Min­
ister of Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of
Germany, speaking on behalf of the Community
delegation , made the two following statements .
</p>
<p>In conclusion, the two delegations noted that agree­
ment had been reached on the basis of these two
statements .
</p>
<p>including the production, marketing and consump­
tion implications for the United Kingdom of the
Community's regimes for milk, pigmeat and eggs .
</p>
<p>2 . There has been a considerable amount of explo­
ration and discussion since then, both with the Com­
mission at a technical level and more generally at
meetings of the Deputies . On our side the aim has
been to see whether any serious problems were likely
to arise and, if so, how they might best be avoided . I
am pleased to be able to say that we have had a good
deal of elucidation and understanding from the
Community, which has helped to clarify matters con­
siderably and leads me to hope that we may be suc­
cessful in reaching agreement on these matters and
thus removing them from our future agenda.
</p>
<p>Milk
</p>
<p>I. Statement made by Mr. G. Rippon, Chancellor of
the Duchy of Lancaster, on behalf of the United
Kingdom delegation
</p>
<p>1 . At the 1st Ministerial meeting on 21 July my
predecessor said that the United Kingdom was ready
to adopt the common agricultural policy within an
enlarged Community . He added, however, that we
should need to consider carefully a number of points,
</p>
<p>We consider it important in the interest of the Com­
munity as well as the United Kingdom that we should
be able to provide adequate supplies of liquid milk to
meet consumer demand throughout the country and</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>27. 3 . 72 Official Journal of the European Communities 199
</p>
<p>We do consider it essential , however, to secure your
recognition of the intrinsic importance of the bacon
market in an enlarged Community ; of the benefits
that its continued stability under conditions of fair
competition would bring - to pig production through­
out the whole Community ; and of the need, there­
fore, to keep this situation under careful review dur­
ing the transitional period and thereafter .
</p>
<p>Eggs
</p>
<p>throughout the year . We believe this will be possible
in the light of the confirmation we have received
from the Community about our understanding of the
scope and nature of the current and proposed arrange­
ments . It is , therefore, important that I should
record the main heads of that understanding, namely :
</p>
<p>( i ) it is one of the objectives of the common policy
to use as much milk as possible for liquid con­
sumption throughout the Community, and the
policy should not be applied so as to impede this
aim ;
</p>
<p>( ii ) the price differential between milk sent for pro­
cessing and milk for liquid consumption contained
in Council Resolution of 24 July 1966 has no
legally binding effect ; it will in due time be
superseded by a Community milk regulation ;
and, under the existing regulations , Member
States are free to fix retail prices for milk for
liquid consumption, but are not obliged to do so ;
</p>
<p>( iii ) Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 refers only to
measures by national governments permitting price
equalization, and accordingly a non-governmental
producer organization, provided it acts with­
in the provisions of the EEC Treaty and of
secondary legislation deriving from it, is free by
its own decisions to consign milk wherever it
chooses in order to get the best return for its
members , to pool its financial returns and to
remunerate its members as it wishes .
</p>
<p>The enlarged Community will be self-sufficient in
eggs so that prices are likely to be determined by in­
ternal market forces rather than by the operation of
measures at the frontiers . Since that is already true
both of the existing Community and of the United
Kingdom, the market of the enlarged Community
may be subject to price fluctuation no different in
kind, although possibly a little greater in degree, than
obtains in the individual markets today . On the other
hand, the trend towards the concentration of produc­
tion in the hands of specialist producers and parallel
developments in marketing should reduce instability
in the longer term. I therefore believe that we shall be
able to adapt to the Community 's arrangements .
</p>
<p>3 . If you are now able formally to confirm that
our understanding of the possibilities open to us for
milk is correct; that you can accept the views I have
expressed on the importance and characteristics of
the bacon market in an enlarged Community and
recognise the desirability of stability for pigmeat and
eggs, we for our part can agree that we need raise no
further points on these items during the negotiations ,
except in the general context of transitional arrange­
ments .
</p>
<p>Pigmeat
</p>
<p>II . Statement made by Mr. W. Scbeel, Minister of
Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Ger­
many, on behalf of the Community delegation
</p>
<p>We consider it also in the interest of an enlarged
Community, expected to be more than self-sufficient
in pigmeat, to ensure adequate market stability, in­
cluding stability on the United Kingdom bacon mar­
ket. The Community's present system, naturally
enough, took no account of this important market—
absorbing annually some 640,000 tons of bacon worth
over 1,000 million units of account. But it could
make a great contribution to stability, not only for
the United Kingdom and other bacon producers who
are directly affected, but to all pig producers in the
enlarged Community .
</p>
<p>We have not concluded from our discussions that the
Community's existing arrangements for pigmeat will
necessarily be inadequate or unsuited for the new
situation emerging from enlargement.
</p>
<p>The Community delegation subscribes to your analy­
sis of the objectives of the common policy in the milk
sector, and of existing possibilities as regards retail
price fixing for liquid milk and the activities of non­
governmental producer organizations . It recalls , in so
far as it may be necessary, that the prohibition of
national measures permitting an equalization of
prices for the various milk products stipulated in Regu­
lation (EEC) No 804/68 applies equally to all national
legislation aimed at achieving such equalization.</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>200 Official Journal of the European Communities 27. 3 . 72
</p>
<p>The Community delegation can accept your state­
ment on the importance and characteristics of the
bacon market in an enlarged Community. In the light
of the objectives pursued by the common policy in
the pigmeat and eggs sectors it shares your concern
for stability in these sectors .
</p>
<p>Noting the statement by the United Kingdom delega­
tion, the Community delegation notes with satisfac­
tion that the existing regulations concerning the three
above-mentioned sectors will not have to be amended
to take into account the anxieties expressed by the
United Kingdom delegation .
</p>
<p>Declaration
</p>
<p>on the system for fixing Community farm prices
</p>
<p>At the 2nd Ministerial Meeting in the negotiations
between the Community and the United Kingdom,
held on 27 October 1970, Mr. W. Scheel, Minister of
Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany,
on behalf of the Community delegation, made a. state­
ment on the system for fixing Community farm
prices .
</p>
<p>Mr. G. Rippon, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lanca­
ster, on behalf of the United Kingdom delegation,
recorded his agreement to this statement. He added
that he had no doubt as to the importance to all con­
cerned of these agricultural reviews and of the inten­
tion to have effective and meaningful contacts in par­
ticular with producer organizations operating at
Community level .
</p>
<p>In conclusion , the two delegations noted that an
agreement had been reached in the terms contained
in the following statement made by Mr. W. Scheel :
</p>
<p>" 1 . Since the discussions held on this subject in
1962, an annual review on the condition of agri­
culture and agricultural markets has been estab­
lished within the Community. This comes under
</p>
<p>. the procedure for fixing Community prices .
</p>
<p>This procedure may de described as follows :
</p>
<p>As a general rule, the various agricultural regula­
tions stipulate that the Council , on a proposal
from the Commission, shall fix for the Com­
munity each year, before 1 August, for the market­
ing year starting the following year, all the agricul­
tural prices which, under the common organiz­
ation of the markets , must be fixed.
</p>
<p>When submitting its proposals, the Commission
at the same time submits an annual report on the
condition of agriculture and agricultural markets .
</p>
<p>This report is submitted in accordance with the
legal obligations of and the undertakings made by
the Commission .
</p>
<p>The Commission draws up this report on the
basis of the relevant statistical and accounting
data from all available national and Community
sources .
</p>
<p>The analysis made in the report comprises the
following :
— examination of the economic condition of
agriculture and of its overall development,
both at national and at Community level , as
well as in the general economic context ;
</p>
<p>— examination of the market by products or
groups of products , in order to provide an
outline of the situation and of its characteristic
trends .
</p>
<p>The review of the data undertaken by the Com­
mission includes, in particular, information about
trends in prices and costs , employment, produc­
tivity and farm incomes .
</p>
<p>Agricultural prices are fixed in accordance with
the procedure laid down in Article 43(2) of the
EEC Treaty, which means that the Assembly must
be consulted.
</p>
<p>To this end, the Commission's proposals, together
with the annual report, are referred to the Assem­
bly, where a general debate is held on the com­
mon agricultural policy.
</p>
<p>In addition, the Economic and Social Committee,
composed of representatives of the various econ­
omic and social sectors, is regularly consulted on
the proposals and the report . As regards the
duties of this Committee, Article 47 of the EEC</p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>27 . 3 . 72 Official Journal of the European Communities 201
</p>
<p>Treaty lays down that its Agricultural Section
shall have as its task that of holding itself at the
service of the Commission for the purpose of pre­
paring the discussions of the Committee, in ac­
cordance with the provisions of Articles 197 and
198 of the EEC Treaty.
</p>
<p>Before, during and after the drawing up by the
Commission of the annual report and the price
proposals, contacts take place with the professional
agricultural organizations organized at Com­
munity level . These contacts include a discussion
of the statistical and other data bearing on the
economic conditions and prospects of agriculture,
which the Commission takes into account in its
report to the Council .
</p>
<p>Because of the nature of the prices fixed under the
common agricultural policy, the Commission has
decided not to limit these contacts to the agricul­
tural sectors alone, but to maintain them also
with industrial, commercial and trade union
circles and with consumers .
</p>
<p>These contacts provide an opportunity for all the
interested parties to make known their views or
claims . They also allow the Commission to draw
up its annual report on the condition of agricul­
ture and its proposals with reg'ard to prices in full
knowledge of the position of the interested par­
ties .
</p>
<p>The consultations of the Assembly and the Econ­
omic and Social Committee, during the policy­
making process leading towards a final decision
of the Council , combined with continual and direct
</p>
<p>contacts between the institution responsible for
drawing up the report and the proposals and the
organizations of the interested parties , are a suf­
ficient guarantee that the interests of all those con­
cerned by the decisions in question are given fair
consideration .
</p>
<p>2 . It is understood that, notwithstanding this
procedure, the Member States may themselves
carry out annual reviews of their own agriculture,
in contact with the professional organizations
concerned and in accordance with their national
procedures .
</p>
<p>3 . The Community delegation proposes that
the Conference take formal note of the following :
</p>
<p>— the procedures and practices within the Com­
munity, as well as in the Member States , will
provide for appropriate contacts with the pro­
fessional organizations concerned;
</p>
<p>— the institutions of the Community intend to
extend the practices and procedures described
in paragraph 1 above to the enlarged Com­
munity ;
</p>
<p>— the application of the two preceding subpara­
graphs will ensure a system within the enlarged
Community whereby it will be possible to
review the economic conditions and prospects
of agriculture and to maintain appropriate
contacts with the professional producer organ­
izations and with other interested organiz­
ations and parties."

<p>At the 8th Ministerial Meeting in the negotiations
between the Community and the United Kingdom,
held on 21 , 22 and 23 June 1971 Mr. G. Rippon,
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, on behalf of
the United Kingdom delegation, made the statement
appearing under I below.
</p>
<p>Mr. M. Schumann, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the
French Republic, on behalf of the Community del­
egation, replied with the statement appearing under II
below.
</p>
<p>I. Statement made by Mr. G. Rippon, Chancellor of
the Duchy of Lancaster, on behalf of the United
Kingdom delegation
</p>
<p>In his opening statement to the Conference of 30
June 1970 Mr. Barber referred, amongst other agricul­
tural issues, to the problems of hill farming areas .
Parts of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and of the
North and South-West of England consist of hill
regions, which because of climate, soil structure and
geography are suitable only for extensive livestock
rearing.</p>

</p>
<p>Farming enterprises in these areas are limited in scope
and are bound to be particularly vulnerable to mar­
ket conditions, so that high end-prices alone will not
enable them to remain viable . Under our present
system, they receive assistance, therefore, both as a
part of our general economic and social policies and
as part of our agricultural policies . Many of the exist­
ing members of the Community certainly have areas
with similar problems and we shall of course deal
with them, as you yourselves already do, in conform­
ity with the Treaty and the common agricultural
policy. I should be grateful for the Community 's con­
firmation of my understanding that it is necessary for
all members of the enlarged Community who face
situations of this kind to deal with the problem of
maintaining reasonable incomes of farmers in such
areas .
</p>
<p>II . Statement made by Mr. M. Schumann, Minister of
Foreign Affairs of the French Republic, on behalf
of the Community delegation
</p>
<p>The Community delegation has taken careful note of
the United Kingdom delegation's statement on hill
</p>
<p>farming in the United Kingdom and measures taken
to support it.
</p>
<p>In reply to this statement, the Community delegation
is in a position to make the following communi­
cation.
</p>
<p>The Community is aware of the special conditions
obtaining to hill farming areas as compared with
other areas of the United Kingdom, as it is , moreover,
of the differences , at times very marked, between
areas in the Member States of the present Com­
munity.
</p>
<p>The special conditions obtaining in certain areas of
the enlarged Community may indeed require action
with a view to attempting to resolve the problems
raised by these special conditions and, in particular,
to preserve reasonable incomes for farmers in such
areas .
</p>
<p>Such action must, of course, as you have just said, be
in conformity with the provisions of the Treaty and
the common agricultural policy.</p>

</p>
<p>In so far as the agreements or conventions between
the Member States, referred to in the second sentence
of Article 3(1 ) and in Article 3(2), exist only in draft,
have not yet been signed, and probably cannot be
signed in the period before accession, the acceding
States will be invited to be associated, after the signa­
ture of the Treaty of Accession and in accordance
with appropriate procedures , in the preparation of
those drafts in a positive spirit and in such manner as
to facilitate their conclusion.
</p>

mark, Ireland, the Kingdom of Norway and the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ire­
land, hereinafter referred to as the " acceding States" are
kept adequately informed, any proposal or communi­
cation from the Commission of the European Com­
munities which might lead to decisions by the Coun­
cil of these Communities shall be brought to the
knowledge of the acceding States after being trans­
mitted to the Council .
</p>

munities and of the acceding States .
</p>
<p>5 . On the Community side, the members of the In­

</p>
<p>6 . The Interim Committee shall be assisted by a
Secretariat which shall be that of the Conference,
continued for this purpose .
</p>

Council has produced common' guidelines enabling
such consultations to be usefully arranged .
</p>
<p>8 . If serious difficulties remain after consultations,
the matter may be raised at Ministerial level at the
request of an acceding State .
</p>
<p>III
</p>
<p>With regard to the negotiation of the agreements
envisaged with the EFTA States which have not ap­
plied for membership of the European Communities ,
and the negotiation of certain adjustments to the pre­
ferential agreements concluded under the Treaties
establishing the European Communities, the repre­
sentatives of the acceding States shall be associated
with the work as observers, side by side with the
representatives of the original Member States.
</p>
<p>Certain non-preferential agreements concluded by the
Community which remain in force after 1 January
1973 may be the subject of adaptations or adjust­
ments in order to take account of the enlargement of
the Community. These adaptations or adjustments
will be negotiated by the Community in association
with the representatives of the acceding States in
accordance with the procedure under the preceding
paragraph.</p>

</p>
<p>The acceding States undertake that the granting of
the licences referred to in Article 2 of Protocols Nos
25 to 28 on the exchange of information in the field
of nuclear energy shall not be deliberately accelerated
before accession with a view to reducing the scope of
the commitments contained in those Protocols .

Agency. With regard to the control agreements which
they might conclude with the Agency, they shall ask
for the inclusion in these agreements of a clause al­
lowing them to replace these agreements as soon as
possible after accession by the verification agreement
which the Community may conclude with the
Agency.
</p>
<p>In the period preceding accession the United King­
dom and the Community shall enter into consul­
tations occasioned by the fact that the control and in­
spection system applicable under the agreement be­
