            <p>In the absence of common personal data protection safeguards at global level, cross-border flows of such data entail a risk of a breach in continuity of the level of protection guaranteed in the European Union. Desirous of facilitating those flows while limiting that risk, the EU legislature has established three mechanisms whereby personal data may be transferred from the European Union to a third State.</p>

Those doubts indirectly called into question the assessments made by the Commission in that respect in the Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250.&nbsp;(<span>

            <p>‘63. … where a person whose personal data has been or could be transferred to a third country which has been the subject of a Commission decision pursuant to Article&nbsp;25(6) of Directive 95/46 lodges with a national supervisory authority a claim concerning the protection of his rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of that data and contests, in bringing the claim&nbsp;…, the compatibility of that decision with the protection of the privacy and of the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, it is incumbent upon the national supervisory authority to examine the claim with all due diligence.</p>

It is incumbent upon the national legislature to provide for legal remedies enabling the national supervisory authority concerned to put forward the objections which it considers well founded before the national courts in order for them, if they share its doubts as to the validity of the Commission decision, to make a reference for a preliminary ruling for the purpose of examination of the decision’s validity.’</p>

Second, Mr&nbsp;Schrems asserts that those standard contractual clauses could not in any event justify the transfer of the personal data relating to him to the United States. That is so because under United States law Facebook Inc. is required make the personal data of its users available to United States authorities, such as the NSA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in the context of surveillance programmes that impede the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Articles&nbsp;7, 8 and&nbsp;47 of the Charter. Mr&nbsp;Schrems claims that there is no remedy that would allow the data subjects to rely on their rights to respect for private life and to protection of personal data. In those circumstances, Mr&nbsp;Schrems asks the DPC to suspend the transfer of such data in application of Article&nbsp;4 of Decision 2010/87.</p>

In particular, evidence relating to the provisions of United States law was submitted by experts. In Irish law, foreign law is considered to be a point of fact to be established by evidence like any other fact. On the basis of that evidence, the referring court assessed the provisions of United States law that authorise surveillance by the Government authorities and agencies, the operation of two publicly recognised surveillance programmes (‘PRISM’ and ‘Upstream’), the various remedies available for individuals whose rights have been violated by surveillance measures and the systematic safeguards and supervisory mechanisms. The High Court set out the results of that assessment in a judgment of 3&nbsp;October 2017 annexed to its order for reference (‘the judgment of the High Court of 3&nbsp;October 2017’).</p>

Communications ‘about’ a selector designate the communications which refer to that selector, without the non-United States person associated with that selector necessarily being a participant in that communication. Although it follows from an opinion of the FISC of 26&nbsp;April 2017 that since that date the United States Government has no longer collected or acquired communications ‘about’ a selector, that opinion does not indicate that the NSA has stopped copying and searching communications flows as they pass through its surveillance equipment. The Upstream programme thus entails access by the NSA to both the metadata and the content of the communications. Since 2011 the NSA has received around 26.5&nbsp;million communications per annum in the context of the Upstream programme, which, however, represents only a small portion of the communications subject to the filtering process carried out on the basis of that programme.</p>

            <p>Following the declaration by the Court in the judgment in <span>Schrems</span> that the ‘safe harbour’ decision was invalid, transfers of personal data to the United States have continued on the basis of other legal provisions. In particular, data-exporting companies have been able to make use of contracts with data importers, incorporating standard clauses drawn up by the Commission. Those clauses also serve as the legal basis for transfers to a multitude of other third countries in respect of which the Commission has not adopted an adequacy decision.&nbsp;(<span>

            <p>The dispute has its origin in an application whereby the DPC requested the referring court to refer to the Court a question for a preliminary ruling on the validity of Decision 2010/87. According to the referring court, the dispute in the main proceedings therefore concerns the exercise of the remedy which the Court enjoined the Member States to provide for in paragraph&nbsp;65 of the judgment in <span>Schrems</span>.</p>

            <p>It will be recalled that the Court held, in paragraph&nbsp;63 of that judgment, that a supervisory authority is required to deal with all due diligence with a complaint in which a person whose personal data have been or could be transferred to a third country which has been the subject of an adequacy decision disputes the compatibility of that decision with the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter. In the words of paragraph&nbsp;65 of that judgment, where the supervisory authority considers that the objections advanced in that complaint are well founded, it must, in accordance with the third indent of the first subparagraph of Article&nbsp;28(3) of Directive 95/46 (to which Article&nbsp;58(5) of the GDPR corresponds), read in the light of Article&nbsp;8(3) of the Charter, be able to engage in legal proceedings. In that regard, it is incumbent upon the national legislature to provide for legal remedies enabling the person concerned to put forward those objections before the national courts in order for them, if they share the supervisory authority’s doubts, to make a reference for a preliminary ruling on the validity of the decision at issue.</p>

            <p>Like the referring court, I consider that those findings apply by analogy when a supervisory authority, when assessing a complaint brought before it, doubts the validity not of an adequacy decision but of a decision, such as Decision 2010/87, setting out standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries. Contrary to the view put forward by the German government, it is not determinative that those doubts are raised by the complainant in arguments before the supervisory authority or that that authority questions, of its own motion, the validity of the decision at issue. In fact, the requirements arising under Article&nbsp;58(5) of the GDPR and Article&nbsp;8(3) of the Charter, on which the Court’s reasoning is based, apply irrespective of the legal basis of the transfer referred to in the complaint lodged with the supervisory authority and of the reasons leading that authority to question the validity of the decision at issue in the context of the adjudication of that compliant.</p>

            <p>That being said, the reason why the DPC asked the referring court to question the Court about the validity of Decision 2010/87 was because she considers that clarification by the Court on that point seems to be necessary in order for her to adjudicate on the complaint whereby Mr&nbsp;Schrems requests her to exercise her power, under the second indent of Article&nbsp;28(3) of Directive 95/46&nbsp;— and now conferred by Article&nbsp;58(2)(f) of the GDPR&nbsp;— to suspend the transfer of the personal data relating to him by Facebook Ireland to Facebook Inc.</p>

It maintains that the referring court has not made clear whether the personal data relating to Mr&nbsp;Schrems were actually transferred to the United States or, if they were, whether they were collected by the United States authorities. Nor was the legal basis for those transfers identified with certainty, as the order for reference merely mentions that the data of European users of the social network Facebook are transferred ‘in large part’ on the basis of the standard contractual clauses provided for in Decision 2010/87. It has not in any event been established that the contract between Facebook Ireland and Facebook Inc., relied on in support of the transfer at issue, faithfully incorporates those clauses. The German Government also disputes the admissibility of the reference for a preliminary ruling on the ground that the referring court did not examine whether Mr&nbsp;Schrems undoubtedly consented to the transfers in question, in which case they were validly based on Article&nbsp;26(1) of Directive 95/46 (the content of which is essentially reproduced in Article&nbsp;49(1)(a) of the GDPR).</p>

            <p>Those arguments do not call into question the relevance of the reference for a preliminary ruling in the light of the object of the dispute in the main proceedings. Since that dispute has its source in the exercise by the DPC of the remedy provided for in paragraph&nbsp;65 of the judgment in <span>Schrems</span>, its very object consists in having the national court make a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling on the validity of Decision 2010/87. The German and United Kingdom Governments are disputing, in reality, the need for the questions for a preliminary ruling not for the purpose of determining whether that decision is valid, but rather for the purpose of putting the DPC in a position to give an actual ruling on Mr&nbsp;Schrems’ complaint.</p>

In fact, the referring court has established that Facebook Ireland has continued to transfer its users’ data to the United States after the ‘safe harbour’ decision was declared invalid and that those transfers are based, at least in part, on Decision 2010/87. Furthermore, while it may be advantageous for all the relevant facts to be established before it exercises its jurisdiction under Article&nbsp;267 TFEU, it is for the referring court alone to determine at what stage of the proceedings it needs a preliminary ruling from the Court.&nbsp;(<span>

            <p>The eighth question invites the Court to determine whether a supervisory authority is required to use the powers conferred on it by Article&nbsp;58(2)(f) and&nbsp;(j) of the GDPR to suspend a transfer to a third country based on the standard contractual clauses provided for in Decision 2010/87 when it considers that the data importer is subject there to obligations that prevent it from honouring those clauses and have the effect that appropriate protection of the transferred data is not guaranteed. In so far as the answer to that question has in my view an impact on the validity of Decision 2010/87,&nbsp;(<span>

As emphasised in recitals&nbsp;108 and&nbsp;114 of the GDPR, the purpose of those mechanisms is to allow transfers to third countries in respect of which the Commission has not adopted an adequacy decision, as any inadequacies in the protection afforded in the legal order of that third country is then <span>compensated</span> by safeguards which the data exporter and importer contractually undertake to respect.</p>

            <p>Since the <span>raison d’être</span> of the contractual safeguards consists specifically in compensating for any deficiencies in the protection afforded by the third country of destination, whatever they may be, the validity of a decision whereby the Commission finds that certain standard clauses adequately compensate for those deficiencies cannot depend on the level of protection guaranteed in each of the individual third countries to which data might be transferred. The validity of such a decision depends only on the soundness of the safeguards which those clauses provide in order to compensate for any inadequacy of the protection afforded in the third country of destination. The effectiveness of those safeguards must be evaluated by taking account also of the safeguards consisting in the powers of the supervisory authorities under Article&nbsp;58(2) of the GDPR.</p>

Thus, the prevailing legal context in the third country of destination may, depending on the actual circumstances of the transfer,&nbsp;(<span>

            <p>In those circumstances, as Mr&nbsp;Schrems and the Commission have observed, the contractual mechanism set out in Article&nbsp;46(2)(c) of the GDPR is based on responsibility being placed on the exporter and, in the alternative, the supervisory authorities. It is on a <span>case-by-case basis</span>, for each specific transfer, that the controller or, failing that, the supervisory authority will examine whether the law of the third country of destination constitutes an obstacle to the implementation of the standard clauses and, therefore, to an adequate protection of the transferred data, so that the transfers must be prohibited or suspended.</p>

The compatibility of Decision 2010/87 with Articles&nbsp;7, 8 and&nbsp;47 of the Charter depends, in my view, on whether there are sufficiently sound mechanisms to ensure that transfers based on the standard contractual clauses are suspended or prohibited where those clauses are breached or impossible to honour.</p>

It will be necessary to ascertain whether the safeguards provided for in the clauses in the annex to Decision 2010/87, supplemented by the powers of the supervisory authorities, make it possible to ensure that that condition is met. That, in my view, is the position only in so far as there is an <span>obligation</span>&nbsp;— placed on the controllers (section&nbsp;1) and, where the latter fail to act, on the supervisory authorities (section&nbsp;2)&nbsp;— to suspend or prohibit a transfer when, because of a conflict between the obligations arising under the standard clauses and those imposed by the law of the third country of destination, those clauses cannot be complied with.</p>

            <p>To my mind, and as Mr&nbsp;Schrems and the Commission have maintained, Clause 5(a) cannot be interpreted as meaning that suspension of the transfer or termination of the contract is merely optional where the importer cannot comply with the standard clauses. Although that clause refers only to a right in that sense for the benefit of the exporter, that wording must be understood by reference to the contractual framework of which it forms part. The fact that the exporter is given a right, <span>in its bilateral relations with the importer</span>, to suspend the transfer or terminate the contract where the importer is unable to honour the standard clauses is without prejudice to the obligation placed on the exporter to do so <span>in the light of the requirements to protect the rights of the persons concerned arising under the GDPR</span>. Any other interpretation would render Decision 2010/87 invalid in that the standard contractual clauses which it sets out would not permit the transfer to be accompanied by ‘appropriate safeguards’ as required by Article&nbsp;46(1) of the GDPR, read in the light of the provisions of the Charter.&nbsp;(<span>

            <p>In addition, according to Clause 5(b) the importer is to certify that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the exporter and its obligations under the contract. In the event of a change in that legislation that is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the standard clauses, the importer will promptly notify that change to the exporter, in which case the exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract. In accordance with Clause 4(g), the exporter must forward the notification received from the importer to the competent supervisory authority if it decides to continue the transfer.</p>

The recognition of a right to a judicial remedy assumes the existence of a strict, and not purely discretionary, power on behalf of the supervisory authorities.

The supervisory authorities’ powers can be exercised only on a case-by-case basis, whereas the deficiencies characteristic of United States law are general and structural in nature. There is thus a risk that different supervisory authorities will adopt diverging decisions in respect of comparable transfers.</p>

                  <a id="c-ECR_62018CC0311_EN_01-E0069" href="#t-ECR_62018CC0311_EN_01-E0069">69</a>
               </span>) that premiss is in my view incorrect. Examination of the law of the third country of destination is relevant only when the Commission adopts an adequacy decision or when the controller&nbsp;— or, failing that, the competent supervisory authority&nbsp;— verifies whether, in the context of a transfer based on appropriate safeguards within the meaning of Article&nbsp;46(1) of the GDPR, the obligations which the law of that third country imposes on the importer undermine the effectiveness of the protection afforded by those safeguards.</p>

To my mind, the Court should not go beyond what is required in order to resolve that dispute, by addressing the questions for a preliminary ruling from the viewpoint of the underlying procedure pending before the DPC. As explained below, that request to show restraint is based, on the one hand, on the desire not to short-circuit the normal progress of the procedure which will have to continue before the DPC after the Court has given a ruling on the validity of Decision 2010/87. On the other hand, in the light of the facts of the case, it would seem to me to be somewhat precipitous, even from the viewpoint of what is at issue in that procedure, for the Court to examine the problems raised by the second to the fifth and by the ninth and tenth questions.</p>

In particular, the referring court has explained that Mr&nbsp;Schrems maintains, in his complaint to the DPC, that the contractual clauses relied on by Facebook Ireland in support of that transfer do not faithfully reflect those set out in the annex to Decision 2010/87.

When the transfer to the United States is not based on the ‘privacy shield’ decision, the supervisory authorities are not formally bound by that decision when exercising the powers conferred on them by Article&nbsp;58(2) of the GDPR. Those authorities might, in other words, distance themselves from the findings made by the Commission as to the adequacy of the level of protection against interferences by the United States public authorities in the exercise of the data subjects’ fundamental rights. The Netherlands Government and the Commission state that the supervisory authorities must nonetheless take those findings into account when using those powers. In the German Government’s opinion, those authorities could reach the opposite conclusion only after a substantive examination, including the relevant investigations, of the findings made by the Commission.</p>

            <p>Conversely, Facebook Ireland and the United States Government claim, in essence, that the binding effect of an adequacy decision means, in the light of the requirements of legal certainty and of the uniform application of EU law, that the supervisory authorities are not authorised to call into question, even when dealing with a complaint seeking suspension of transfers to the third country in question on a basis other than that decision, the findings made in that decision.</p>

            <p>I subscribe to the first of those two approaches. As the scope of the ‘privacy shield’ decision is limited to transfers made to an undertaking which has self-certified on the basis of that decision, the decision cannot formally constrain the supervisory authorities in the case of transfers that do not fall within its scope. The ‘privacy shield’ decision likewise claims to ensure legal certainty only for the benefit of exporters who transfer data within the framework which it establishes. To my mind, the independence that Article&nbsp;52 of the GDPR recognises to the supervisory authorities also tends to preclude their being bound by the findings made by the Commission in an adequacy decision falling outside its scope.</p>

            <p>Clearly, the findings made in the ‘privacy shield’ decision relating to the adequacy of the level of protection ensured in the United States against the interferences connected with the activities of its intelligence services constitute the starting-point of the analysis whereby a supervisory authority assesses, on a case-by-case basis, whether a transfer based on standard contractual clauses must be suspended because of such interferences. However, if it considers, following a thorough investigation, that it is unable to support those findings as regards the transfer brought to its attention, the competent supervisory authority retains, in my view, the option to exercise the powers conferred on it by Article&nbsp;58(2)(f) and&nbsp;(j) of the GDPR.</p>

            <p>As the wording of Article&nbsp;44 of the GDPR is not conclusive, a teleological interpretation leads me to adopt the second of those interpretations and therefore to support the second of the approaches referred to above. If the requirement of continuity of the level of protection laid down in that provision were considered to cover only the surveillance measures implemented within the territory of the third country of destination, it could be circumvented when that third country applied such measures outside its territory during the stage in which the data are in transit. In order to avoid that risk, the evaluation of the adequacy of the level of protection ensured by a third country must cover all the provisions, in particular in national security matters, of the legal order of that third country,&nbsp;(<span>

The ‘essential equivalence’ test should therefore in my view be applied in such a way as to preserve a certain flexibility in order to take the various legal and cultural traditions into account.

               </span>) which provides that the use of external intelligence must be ‘as tailored as feasible’. However, it expressly refers to the possibility of collecting data ‘in bulk’ outside the territory of the United States for the purposes of pursuing certain specific national security objectives.&nbsp;(<span>

               </span>) In Mr&nbsp;Schrems’ view, the provisions of PPD&nbsp;28, which, incidentally, does not create rights for individuals, do not protect data subjects against the risk of generalised access to the content of their electronic communications.</p>

In particular, the inspector-generals, belonging to the internal structure of each agency, are not, in my view, independent control mechanisms.

In exceptional cases where data exporters refuse or are unable to instruct the data importer properly, with an imminent risk of grave harm to the data subjects, the standard contractual clauses should allow the supervisory authorities to audit data importers and sub-processors and, where appropriate, take decisions which are binding on data importers and sub-processors. The supervisory authorities should have the power to prohibit or suspend a data transfer or a set of transfers based on the standard contractual clauses in those exceptional cases where it is established that a transfer on contractual basis is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations providing adequate protection for the data subject.’</p>

      </span>)	Although the referring court states that its request for a preliminary ruling concerns the validity of the three SCC decisions, which are examined in the DPC’s draft decision and in the judgment of 3&nbsp;October 2017, the questions for a preliminary ruling relate exclusively to Decision 2010/87. The same applies since, before that court, Facebook Ireland identified that decision as the legal basis of the transfers of the data of European users of the Facebook social network to the United States. My analysis will therefore relate solely to that decision.</p>

      </span>)	Let us imagine, for example, that a third country lays down an obligation for telecommunications services providers to grant the public authorities access to the data transferred without any restrictions or safeguards.

      </span>)	I note, moreover, that Clause 5(d)(i) exempts the importer from his obligation to inform the exporter of a legally binding request for disclosure by a law enforcement authority of the third country where the law of that third country prohibits such information being given. In such situations, the exporter will be unable to suspend the transfer if that disclosure, of which he will be unaware, infringes the standard clauses. However, under Clause 5(a) the importer is still required to inform the exporter, where appropriate, of the fact that he considers that the legislation of that third country prevents him from fulfilling his obligations under the contractual clauses agreed between them.</p>

Paragraph&nbsp;2.9 of that judgment continues: ‘Here, the only issue of substance which arises before either the Irish courts or the CJEU is the question of the validity or otherwise of Union measures. Whatever the view taken by the CJEU on that issue, <span>the Irish courts will have no further role, for the measures under question will either be found to be valid or invalid and in either event, that will be the end of the matter</span>’ (emphasis added).</p>

      </span>)	For that reason, the Supreme Court, in its judgment of 31&nbsp;May 2019 (paragraphs&nbsp;8.1 to&nbsp;8.5), while acknowledging that it had no jurisdiction to call into question the referring court’s decision to refer the questions for a preliminary ruling to the Court or to amend the terms of those questions, expressed doubts as to the need for some of those questions. In particular, paragraph&nbsp;8.5 of that judgment states: ‘The sole purpose of the proceedings before the courts in Ireland was to enable the High Court to refer that question of validity to the CJEU and obtain a definitive answer from the only court which has competence to make the decision in question. It is difficult, therefore, to see how the High Court needs answers to many of the questions which have been referred, for the answers to those questions are only relevant to the question of the validity of the challenged measures&nbsp;….’</p>

That being said, paragraph&nbsp;307 of the judgment of the High Court of 3&nbsp;October 2017 acknowledges: ‘It is fair to conclude&nbsp;… that the decision of the Commission in regard to the adequacy of the protections afforded to EU citizens against interference by the intelligence authorities in the [U.S.] with the fundamental rights of EU citizens whose data are transferred from the [EU] to the [U.S.], conflicts with the case made by the DPC to this court’.</p>

      </span>)	In order to avoid any confusion on this point, I would emphasise that, in the ‘privacy shield’ decision, the Commission was not in a position to determine whether the United States does actually intercept communications sent via the transatlantic cables, since the United States authorities did not confirm or deny that proposition (see recital&nbsp;75 of that decision and letter of 22&nbsp;February 2016 from Mr&nbsp;Robert Litt, in Annex&nbsp;VI, paragraph&nbsp;I(a), thereto). However, since the United States Government has not denied collecting data in transit on the basis of EO 12333, the Commission was in my view required, before making a finding of adequacy, to obtain assurances from the United States Government that such data-gathering, on the assumption that it did take place, would be accompanied by sufficient safeguards against the risks of misuse. It is from that aspect that the Commission, in recitals&nbsp;68 to&nbsp;77 of that decision, examined the limitations and safeguards that were to apply in such a situation pursuant to PPD&nbsp;28.</p>

The Court justified that conclusion by the fact that Directive 2006/24, unlike the decision at issue in the <span>PNR</span> judgment, governed only the activities of services providers in the internal market and did not regulate the activities of public authorities for law-enforcement purposes. By that reasoning, the Court seems to have confirmed that, conversely, the conclusion drawn in the <span>PNR</span> judgment would have been capable of being transposed to provisions relating to access to the retained data or to their use by those authorities.</p>

      </span>)	In the judgment in <span>Tele2 Sverige</span>, although the Court concentrated on examining the justification for the interferences resulting from the retention and access measures at issue by reference to the objective of combating criminal offences, the conclusion which it reached also applies, <span>mutatis mutandis</span>, where such measures are aimed at protecting national security. Article&nbsp;15(1) of Directive 2002/58 mentions, among the objectives capable of justifying such measures, both the fight against criminal offences and the protection of national security. Furthermore, Article&nbsp;1(3) of Directive 2002/58 and Article&nbsp;2(2) of the GDPR preclude from the scope of those measures State activities in both national security matters and areas of criminal law. Moreover, the measures at issue in the case that gave rise to the judgment in <span>Tele2 Sverige</span> also pursued an aim linked with national security. In paragraph&nbsp;119 of that judgment, the Court expressly addressed the issue of justification for measures relating to the retention of and access to traffic and location data in the light of the objective of protecting national security in that it encompasses the fight against terrorism.</p>

In particular, the Commission had not established the existence of State rules intended to limit any interferences with data subjects’ fundamental rights (judgment in <span>Schrems</span>, paragraph&nbsp;88) or of effective legal protection against such interferences (judgment in <span>Schrems</span>, paragraph&nbsp;89).</p>

      </span>)	Although processing may infringe both Articles&nbsp;7 and&nbsp;8 of the Charter, the relevant framework of analysis for the purposes of applying Article&nbsp;8 is structurally different from that applicable to Article&nbsp;7. The right to protection of personal data means, in the words of Article&nbsp;8(2) of the Charter, that ‘such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law’ and that ‘everyone has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified’. Infringement of that right assumes that personal data have been processed in breach of those requirements. That is the case, in particular, where the processing is not based on either the consent of the person concerned <span>or on some other legitimate basis laid down by law</span>. In such a situation, although the question of the existence of an interference and that of its justification are conceptually distinct in the context of Article&nbsp;7 of the Charter, they overlap in the case of Article&nbsp;8 of the Charter.</p>

Congress had however provided, in the act reapproving the FISA adopted in 2018, the possibility of introducing that type of searches with the consent of the FISC and Congress. See also EDPB, EU-U.S.&nbsp;Privacy Shield&nbsp;— Second Annual Joint Review, 22&nbsp;January 2019 (p.&nbsp;27, paragraph&nbsp;55).</p>

      </span>)	From that aspect, the referring court, in paragraphs&nbsp;188 and&nbsp;189 of its judgment of 3&nbsp;October 2017, distinguishes ‘bulk searching’ and ‘bulk acquisition, collection or retention’. It considers, essentially, that, if the Upstream programme involves ‘bulk’ searching in all the data flows passing through the telecommunications ‘backbone’, the acquisition, collection and retention are targeted in the sense that they are aimed only at the data containing the selectors in question.</p>

The Supreme Court observes: ‘it is inevitable that any screening process designed to identify data of interest will necessarily involve all of the data available, for the whole point of the screening process is to identify within that entire universe of available data the relevant material which may be of interest and thus require closer scrutiny. Perhaps part of the problem lies in the fact that the term “processing” covers a wide range of activity, apparently, in the view of the DPC, including screening. On the assumption that that is a correct view of the law, then it is technically correct to describe bulk screening as involving indiscriminate processing. But the use of that terminology might be taken to imply that other forms of processing, which are significantly more invasive, are carried out on an indiscriminate basis.’</p>

I note that, according to the PCLOB report (pp.&nbsp;51 to&nbsp;66), the NSA’s ‘minimisation’ procedures on the basis of section&nbsp;702 of the FISA are aimed, so far as most of their aspects are concerned, only at United States persons. PPD&nbsp;28 was intended to extend the applicable safeguards to non-United States persons. See PCLOB, Report to the President on the Implementation of [PPD&nbsp;28]: Signals Intelligence Activities, available at https://www.pclob.gov/reports/report-PPD28/ (p.&nbsp;2). That being so, the storage and use of data for national security purposes after they have been acquired by the public authorities does not in my view fall within the scope of EU law (see point&nbsp;226 of this Opinion). The adequacy of the level of protection ensured in the context of those activities must therefore be evaluated only by reference to Article&nbsp;8 of the ECHR.</p>

While internal security may be affected by, inter alia, a direct threat to the peace of mind and physical security of the population of the Member State concerned, external security may be jeopardised by, inter alia, the risk of a serious disturbance to the foreign relations or the peaceful coexistence of nations. Without being able to determine unilaterally the content of those concepts, each Member State has a certain discretion to define its essential interests in terms of security.

      </span>)	Judgment in <span>Tele2 Sverige</span> (paragraph&nbsp;121), and Opinion 1/15 (paragraph&nbsp;220). As Facebook Ireland has observed, notification of access by the public authorities to the data cannot be systematically required. In that respect, the ECtHR considers that ‘it may not be feasible in practice to require subsequent notification’, since the threat against which the surveillance measures is directed ‘may continue for years, even decades’, after suspension of those measures, so that notification may ‘jeopardise the long-term purpose that originally prompted the surveillance’ and ‘might serve to reveal the working methods and fields of operation of the intelligence services and&nbsp;… to identify their agents’ (judgment in <span>Zakharov</span> (§ 287 and the case-law cited)). In the absence of notification, although individual remedies may therefore be impracticable in the event of breach of the legal requirements, other safeguards may suffice to protect the right to respect for private life (see also judgment in <span>Centrüm för Rättvisa</span>, §§ 164 to&nbsp;167 and&nbsp;171 to&nbsp;178).

      </span>)	In its case-law on telecommunications surveillance measures, the ECtHR has addressed the question of remedies in the context of the examination of the ‘quality of law’ and the need for an interference with the exercise of the right guaranteed in Article&nbsp;8 of the ECHR (see in particular judgments in <span>Zakharov</span> (§ 236) and in <span>Centrüm för Rättvisa</span> (§ 107)). In the judgment of 1&nbsp;July 2008, <span>Liberty and others v. United Kingdom</span> (CE:ECHR:2008:0701JUD005824300, § 73), and the judgment in <span>Zakharov</span> (§ 307), the ECtHR, after finding that there had been a violation of Article&nbsp;8 of the ECHR, did not consider it necessary to examine separately the complaint based on Article&nbsp;13 of that Convention.</p>

      </span>)	According to the ECtHR, although the failure to notify at any stage does not necessarily prevent a surveillance measure from meeting the condition that it be ‘necessary in a democratic society’, it undermines access to the courts and thus the effectiveness of the remedies (see, in particular, judgment of 6&nbsp;September 1978, <span>Klass and others v.

      </span>)	In the judgment in <span>Big Brother Watch</span> (§ 317), the ECtHR refused to add, among the minimum guarantees applicable to a surveillance regime characterised by the bulk interception of electronic communications, a requirement that the surveillance be notified to the persons concerned. See, also, judgment in <span>Centrüm för Rättvisa</span> (§ 164). The referral of those judgments to the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR relates, inter alia, to the reconsideration of that conclusion.</p>

      </span>)	The concept of independence has a first aspect, which is external and presumes that the body concerned is protected against external intervention or pressure liable to jeopardise the independent judgment of its members as regards proceedings before them. The second aspect of that concept, which is internal, is linked to impartiality and seeks to ensure a level playing field for the parties to the proceedings and their respective interests with regard to the subject matter of those proceedings.
