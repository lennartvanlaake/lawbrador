First, the national regulation requires a banking licence in order to carry out activities in the field of occupational pensions. Second, in the context of those activities, unlike an undertaking providing pensions, the provident fund bears no risk. Third, the employer’s only consideration takes the form of a levy by that fund of administrative charges, the contributions paid monthly to that fund by the employer not being a consideration but capital to be managed. Therefore, taking as the basis for the calculation the administrative charges retained by the provident fund as remuneration, the referring court concludes that the market value amounts to EUR 174000 and that, consequently, it does not reach the threshold set out in respect of public service contracts in Article 4(c) of Directive 2014/24.</p>

The referring court observes that the description of economic transactions included in the BVergG 2006 is uniform in respect of all contracts, whether or not they reach the threshold, and that it is based on the provisions of Directive 2014/24, as is apparent from the explanatory memorandum featuring in the draft law submitted for the adoption of the BVergG 2006.</p>

In that regard, referring to the case-law, the referring court concludes that, in the present case, there is some cross-border interest, having regard to the amount of the contract, its nature and that of the activity of managing and investing contributions at issue in the main proceedings, which does not require the physical presence of staff.</p>

In that latter case, the contracting authorities’ decision-making autonomy was called into question, because those authorities, under the applicable collective agreement, could not, of their own accord, give preference to a particular tenderer. In response to that argument, the Court held that it was, however, sufficient that the employers concerned could have had an influence on the choice of their contracting party, at least indirectly, by means of a collective agreement.</p>

               <p class="normal">It is therefore important that the rules relating to the award procedure should be applied transparently to all tenderers. The obligation of transparency, which is a corollary of the principle of equality, is designed essentially to ensure that any interested operator may take the decision to tender, in a public procurement procedure, on the basis of all relevant information and to ensure the elimination of any risk of favouritism or arbitrariness on the part of the contracting authority. It implies that all the conditions and detailed rules governing the award procedure must be drawn up in a clear, precise and unequivocal manner so that, first, all reasonably informed tenderers exercising ordinary care can understand their exact significance and interpret them in the same way and, second, the contracting authority is able to ascertain whether the bids submitted satisfy the criteria applying to the contract in question (see, to that effect, judgments of 4 February 2016, Ince, <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2016%3A72&locale=en"
