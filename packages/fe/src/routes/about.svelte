<h1>Lawbrador</h1>

Lawbrador wants to make the law accessible for everyone. We are creating a platform from which you can access any legal resource, do your research and share it.

Lawbrador is in the early stages of development. Many features that we would like to have are not yet there and bugs may occur regularly. Please contact <a href="mailto:lennartvanlaake@gmail.com">me</a> if you encounter a bug or would like to comment on the application.

<h2>How it works</h2>

Instead of saving the legal universe to a private database, Lawbrador passes on the search results of official legal sources. Based on a configuratble set of rules Lawbrador reformats the original page into a generic format. Then Lawbrador allows you to research that text any way you want.

This means that all the results you see in Lawbrador are directly imported from their source. By clicking a link at the top of a results page you can view the original document.

At this moment we only support searching Eurlex, the official source for EU law, with a limited number of search parameters. In the future we will expand the number of sources and available search parameters.

<h2>Help wanted!</h2>

We want Lawbrador to work well for both lawyers and non-lawyers. To check that we are currently doing that we are always looking for people to test the current state of our application and give us feedback. Please contact me at lennartvanlaake[at]gmail.com if you have any comments or are interested in previewing our application.
